# Fundamentals-of-Deep-Learning

Contains lab work from my applied fundamentals of deep learning course (APS360). This course introduced a wide range of machine learning topics including ANNs, CNNs, RNNs, unsupervised learning, autoencoders, GANs, LSTMs, transformers, GNNs, and metrics to assess model performance.<br />

Each lab consists of building a machine learning model using PyTorch on Google Colab. <br /> <br />

**Labs**
<ul> 
  <li>Lab 1: PyTorch and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)</li>
  <li>Lab 2: Classifying Cats and Dogs With Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</li>
  <li>Lab 3: Translating American Sign Language (ASL) With Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</li>
  <li>Lab 4: Data Imputation With Autoencoders</li>
  <li>Lab 5: Spam Detection With Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</li>
</ul> <br />
